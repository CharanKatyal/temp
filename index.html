    <h1>Geometry in Ancient India (Vedic Geometry)</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Vedic Geometry</strong>: Used during the Vedic period (1500 BCE â€“ 500 BCE) in religious, architectural, and astronomical practices.</li>
        <li>Geometry was applied practically, especially in constructing altars and understanding the cosmos.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Texts: The Sulba Sutras</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Sulba Sutras</strong>: Vedic texts that primarily focus on the construction of <strong>fire altars</strong> for rituals.</li>
        <li><strong>Shapes</strong>: Used <strong> squares</strong>, <strong>rectangles</strong>, and <strong>triangles</strong> in altar design.</li>
        <li><strong>Pythagoras' Theorem</strong>: Describes principles similar to the Pythagorean theorem, used to create right-angled triangles for precise altar construction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Applications of Geometry</h2>
    <h3>Rituals</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Accurate geometric shapes were essential for building altars.</li>
        <li>Each shape had symbolic meaning:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Square</strong> = Earth</li>
                <li><strong>Circle</strong> = Time and Cyclical Nature</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Architecture</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The <strong>Vaastu Shastra</strong> later emphasized geometric design in temples and buildings to align with cosmic forces.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Astronomy and Calendars</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Geometry played a key role in <strong>Vedic astronomy</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Celestial Predictions</strong>: Used geometric calculations to predict eclipses and other celestial events.</li>
                <li><strong>Astronomical Instruments</strong>: Geometry was essential in designing instruments to track the stars and planets.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Vedic Geometry</strong> was not just theoretical but a practical tool integrated into daily life, rituals, and architecture.</li>
        <li>The <strong>Sulba Sutras</strong> show early use of geometric principles, which influenced later advancements in Indian mathematics, architecture, and astronomy.</li>
    </ul>
